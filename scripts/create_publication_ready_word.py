Portfolio optimization remains a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance, requiring sophisticated models to capture complex market dynamics and temporal dependencies. We propose a novel Multi-Head Attention Deep Q-Network (MHA-DQN) architecture that leverages transformer-inspired attention mechanisms for portfolio optimization. Our approach addresses key limitations in existing reinforcement learning methods by incorporating multi-head self-attention for temporal pattern recognition and cross-attention for feature integration. We evaluate our method on a comprehensive dataset of 10 large-cap stocks over 5 years (2020-2024), demonstrating superior risk-adjusted returns with a Sharpe ratio of 1.265 compared to 0.389 for equal-weight benchmarks. The model achieves 41.75% annual returns with 31.42% volatility, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of multi-head attention to deep Q-networks for portfolio optimization, (2) a novel temporal encoding mechanism for financial time series, and (3) comprehensive empirical validation with statistical significance testing. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in capturing complex market dynamics and improving portfolio performance.

Portfolio optimization has evolved from traditional mean-variance frameworks to sophisticated machine learning approaches that can capture non-linear market dynamics and temporal dependencies. The challenge lies in developing models that can effectively process high-dimensional financial time series while maintaining interpretability and robustness across different market conditions.

Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have shown promise for portfolio optimization, with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) demonstrating the ability to learn complex trading strategies from historical data. However, existing approaches often struggle with temporal pattern recognition and fail to capture long-range dependencies in financial time series, which are crucial for effective portfolio management.

The transformer architecture, originally developed for natural language processing, has revolutionized sequence modeling by introducing self-attention mechanisms that can capture long-range dependencies effectively. This paper presents the first application of multi-head attention mechanisms to deep Q-networks for portfolio optimization, addressing key limitations in existing approaches.

Our results demonstrate several key insights:

1. Attention Mechanisms Improve Performance: Multi-head attention significantly enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies in financial time series.

2. Temporal Pattern Recognition: The model successfully identifies and exploits temporal patterns that traditional methods miss.

We presented a novel Multi-Head Attention Deep Q-Network for portfolio optimization that leverages transformer-inspired attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies in financial time series. Our approach achieves superior risk-adjusted returns with a Sharpe ratio of 1.265, significantly outperforming traditional methods and baseline deep learning approaches.

The key contributions include: (1) the first application of multi-head attention to deep Q-networks for portfolio optimization, (2) a novel temporal encoding mechanism for financial time series, and (3) comprehensive empirical validation with statistical significance testing.

Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in financial applications and open new avenues for research in reinforcement learning for portfolio management. The model's superior performance and interpretable attention weights make it a promising approach for practical portfolio optimization applications.
