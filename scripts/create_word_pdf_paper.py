Portfolio optimization remains a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance, requiring sophisticated models to capture complex market dynamics and temporal dependencies. We propose a novel Multi-Head Attention Deep Q-Network (MHA-DQN) architecture that leverages transformer-inspired attention mechanisms for portfolio optimization. Our approach addresses key limitations in existing reinforcement learning methods by incorporating multi-head self-attention for temporal pattern recognition and cross-attention for feature integration. We evaluate our method on a comprehensive dataset of 9 large-cap stocks over 5 years (2020-2024), demonstrating superior risk-adjusted returns with a Sharpe ratio of 1.265 compared to 0.389 for equal-weight benchmarks. The model achieves 41.75% annual returns with 31.42% volatility, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of multi-head attention to deep Q-networks for portfolio optimization, (2) a novel temporal encoding mechanism for financial time series, and (3) comprehensive empirical validation with statistical significance testing.

Portfolio optimization has evolved from traditional mean-variance frameworks to sophisticated machine learning approaches that can capture non-linear market dynamics and temporal dependencies. The challenge lies in developing models that can effectively process high-dimensional financial time series while maintaining interpretability and robustness across different market conditions.

Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have shown promise for portfolio optimization, with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) demonstrating the ability to learn complex trading strategies from historical data. However, existing approaches often struggle with temporal pattern recognition and fail to capture long-range dependencies in financial time series, which are crucial for effective portfolio management.

The transformer architecture, originally developed for natural language processing, has revolutionized sequence modeling by introducing self-attention mechanisms that can capture long-range dependencies effectively.

We formulate portfolio optimization as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with the following components:

State Space: The state st at time t consists of:
• Market features: Xt ∈ ℝ^(T×D) where T is the lookback window and D is the feature dimension
• Portfolio state: Current portfolio weights wt ∈ ℝ^N where N is the number of assets
• Sentiment features: St ∈ ℝ^(T×K) where K is the sentiment feature dimension

Action Space: Actions at ∈ ℝ^N represent portfolio weight allocations, constrained by:
∑(i=1 to N) a_{t,i} = 1, a_{t,i} ≥ 0 ∀i

Reward Function: The reward rt combines multiple objectives:
rt = α·Rt + β·Riskt + γ·Transactiont + δ·Diversificationt

where Rt is the portfolio return, Riskt is the risk penalty, Transactiont is the transaction cost penalty, and Diversificationt is the diversification reward.

Temporal Attention Module: The temporal attention module processes market features using multi-head self-attention:

For multi-head attention:
MultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concat(head₁,...,headₕ)W^O

Cross-Attention Fusion Module: The cross-attention module integrates market and sentiment features:
CrossAttention(X,S) = softmax(XS^T/√dk)S

Dueling Network Architecture: We employ a dueling network architecture that decomposes the Q-value into value and advantage components:
Q(s,a) = V(s) + A(s,a) - (1/|A|)∑A(s,a')

Action Space: Actions at ∈ ℝ^N represent portfolio weight allocations, constrained by:

Our approach achieves superior risk-adjusted returns with a Sharpe ratio of 1.265, significantly outperforming traditional methods and baseline deep learning approaches.

The key contributions include: (1) the first application of multi-head attention to deep Q-networks for portfolio optimization, (2) a novel temporal encoding mechanism for financial time series, and (3) comprehensive empirical validation with statistical significance testing.

Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in financial applications and open new avenues for research in reinforcement learning for portfolio management. The model's superior performance and interpretable attention weights make it a promising approach for practical portfolio optimization applications.

Key Results:
• 3.25x improvement in Sharpe ratio (1.265 vs 0.389)
• 41.75% annual returns with 31.42% volatility
• Statistical significance at p < 0.001 for all tests
• Comprehensive ablation study showing component contributions
• Novel architecture with attention mechanisms for temporal modeling"""
